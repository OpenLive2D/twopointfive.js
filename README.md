===============

#### JavaScript Live 2D library ####

This project is aimed at creating a flexible, cross-platform and open Live 2D library based on available technologies such as HTML5 and WebGl. 

### Usage ###

The project is still in alpha stage. It is not fit for production use, yet. 

### Naming ###

The project's name is inspired by two projects: three.js (which offers a great js 3D library) and two.js (which offers a js 2D library). twopointfive.js manipulates 2D images according to a 3D model to create a pseudo-3D movement on a 2D graphic.
